# 🎨 Etch-a-Sketch
A fun, interactive web-based sketchpad that lets you draw pixelated designs directly in your browser! Built with **HTML, CSS,** and **JavaScript**, this project is a fantastic way to explore DOM manipulation, Flexbox, and event-driven programming.

## 🌟 Features
 - **Dynamic Grid Creation**: A 16x16 grid is generated dynamically using JavaScript for a seamless setup.
 - **Hover-to-Draw**: Hover over grid squares to leave a pixelated trail, mimicking a sketching experience.
 - **Custom Grid Resizing**: Users can resize the grid (up to 100x100) while maintaining the same canvas size.
 - **Randomized Colors**: Interacting with grid squares generates random RGB colors for a creative twist.
 - **Responsive Design**: The sketchpad adjusts beautifully across screen sizes and grid configurations.
